; The following lines are similar to Lab-1 but use a defined address to make it easier.
; They just turn off all LEDs 
				LDR			R10, =LED_BASE_ADR		; R10 is a permenant pointer to the base address for the LEDs, offset of 0x20 and 0x40 for the ports

				MOV 		R3, #0xB0000000		; Turn off three LEDs on port 1

; This line is very important in your main program
; Initializes R11 to a 16-bit non-zero value and NOTHING else can write to R11 !!
